## **Overview**

* The base API endpoint is: **https://fapi.asterdex.com**
* A User Data Stream `listenKey` is valid for 60 minutes after creation.
* Doing a `PUT` on a `listenKey` will extend its validity for 60 minutes.
* Doing a `DELETE` on a `listenKey` will close the stream and invalidate the `listenKey`.
* Doing a `POST` on an account with an active `listenKey` will return the currently active `listenKey` and extend its validity for 60 minutes.
* The baseurl for websocket is **wss://fstream.asterdex.com**
* User Data Streams are accessed at **/ws/\<listenKey\>**
* User data stream payloads are **not guaranteed** to be in order during heavy periods; **make sure to order your updates using E**
* A single connection to **fstream.asterdex.com** is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be disconnected at the 24 hour mark

{
    "e":"MARGIN_CALL",    	// Event Type
    "E":1587727187525,		// Event Time
